# OOP_Assignment5, Version 2
This is my github repo for the COMP2021 Assignment 5, version 2

To compile and test my project you should run the following commands:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dicksonhk/OOP_Assignment_5.git
$ cd OOP_Assignment5/
$ cd Assignment5/
$ ant compile
$ ant test
```
After that you might want to cleanup the files generated by *Ant*,
in that case you could do so by running the following command:
```sh
$ ant clean
```
# Q: Why I don't name the repo "Assignment5"?
A: Coz the name Assignment5 is not descriptive, and I prefer a more meaningful name :)

#
#
#
# Remarks
I got error when compiling on winodws, which is caused by some (possibly?) illegal characters in *FormRAtree.java*:
```
31| 			//split CourseEnroll.courseID = “COMP2021” into three parts
```
The quote had caused error when compiling, so if you got error on this, its not my fault!!!!

I solved by modifying this line (notice that the quote is different):
```
31| 			//split CourseEnroll.courseID = "COMP2021" into three parts
```

**And this is really finally the end of the Readme~**
